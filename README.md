# Project 2 â€“ Syntax Analyzer

This project adds a syntax analyzer that checks whether source code follows the grammar rules of the language.  
It parses the token stream produced by the lexical analyzer and reports syntax errors with their locations.  
If no errors are found, the program confirms that the code is syntactically valid.
